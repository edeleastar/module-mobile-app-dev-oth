# Room Classes

In 2017 Google introduced a vastly simplified approach to persisting objects to the SQLite database called Rooms:

- <https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/index.html>

Review the introduction above (just the page linked) before proceeding.

First, we need to include the rooms libraries:

## build.gradle

A new plugin at the top of the file:

~~~
apply plugin: "kotlin-kapt"
~~~


New libraries:

~~~gradle
  implementation 'androidx.room:room-runtime:2.1.0'
  kapt 'androidx.room:room-compiler:2.1.0'
~~~

Note the second dependency is slightly different - a `kapt` entry. Kapt is an annotation processor:

- <https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html>

and we are using it here to engage the Room annotations we are about to use.

Rebuild now to make sure the libraries are correctly included.
