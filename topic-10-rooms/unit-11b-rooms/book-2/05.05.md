# Anko Coroutines - PlacemarkListPresenter

Android will not permit access to the database on the main UI thread - as it can seriously degrade performance. 

When working with Kotlin we have some convenience methods available via the anko libraries when attempting multi-threaded development in Android. These two short articles provide some basic context:

- <https://workingdev.net/2018/08/android-using-ankos-doasync-to-do.html>
- <https://antonioleiva.com/anko-background-kotlin-android>

The above use the anko libraries we are already using:

We need to make changes to these three presenters to make sure that any access to the database takes place off the main thread:

- PlacemarkPresenter
- PlacemarkListPresenter
- PlacemarkMapPresenter

We start with PlacemarkListPresenter. Currently it has the following method:

~~~kotlin
  fun loadPlacemarks() {
    view?.showPlacemarks(app.placemarks.findAll())
  }
~~~

This is called from PlacemarkListView:

~~~kotlin
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_placemark_list)
    super.init(toolbar, false);

    presenter = initPresenter(PlacemarkListPresenter(this)) as PlacemarkListPresenter

    val layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(this)
    recyclerView.layoutManager = layoutManager
    presenter.loadPlacemarks()
  }
~~~

Clearly this call is originating from the main thread. In the presenter, change the implementation of loadPlacemarks:

~~~kotlin
  fun loadPlacemarks() {
    doAsync {
      val placemarks = app.placemarks.findAll()
      uiThread {
        view?.showPlacemarks(placemarks)
      }
    }
  }
~~~

Tun the app now, and it should launch without an error. 

However, it will still crash if you try to add a placemark (next step).
