We will be introducing a new package here in the next lab

## Exercise 2: Location Update

If you now open the Edit Location view, it will always display the location as

i.e. it always shows 00.00000 for lat/lng initially.  

As soon as you move the placemark it is updated correctly. Fix this now.
