# Up Support

Part of the AppBar components we are using has automatic `Up` support:

- <https://developer.android.com/training/appbar/up-action>

Now that all our Views are derived from a `BaseView` class - and we have already established the PARENT relationship in the previous step - introducing this button into all views is fairly simple:


## BaseView

We already have this function, which we can extend:

~~~kotlin
  fun init(toolbar: Toolbar, upEnabled: Boolean) {
    toolbar.title = title
    setSupportActionBar(toolbar)
    supportActionBar?.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(upEnabled)
  }
~~~

We make `upEnabled` a boolean parameter,  as it  does not make sense for all views to have the Up button.

This change then to all all views:


## EditLocationView

~~~
    super.init(toolbar, true)
~~~

## PlacemarkView

~~~
    super.init(toolbarAdd, true);
~~~

## PlacemarkMapView

~~~
    super.init(toolbar, true);
~~~

## PlacemarkListView

~~~
    super.init(toolbar, false)
~~~

Try this now - all views, except list, should have the up button.
