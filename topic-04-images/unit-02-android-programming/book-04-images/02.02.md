# Model Updates

Currently we can successfully add and edit placemarks. However, although the edit is updating the model, the model is not being refreshed on the view (it is still displaying the original placemark).

Here is a simple addition to fix this - a new method in PlacemarkListActivity:

## PlacemarkListActivity:

```
  override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    recyclerView.adapter?.notifyDataSetChanged()
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
  }
```

This is another lifecycle event - this time to be triggered when an activity we have started finishes. We instruct the recyclerView's adapter that the model has been updated.

This should trigger an update and the correct values displayed in the list.
