# Solution

Placemark application so far:

- [placemark-04.zip](archives/placemark-04.zip)

## Exercise 1

As a user, create a new placemark with a title + image. Now edit the placemark and change the title - and update the placemark. Notice that the title has changed in PlacemarkList.

Edit the placemark and change the image - and update the placemark. Go back in to edit the placemark again - what image do you see?

There is a bug here - the placemark activity is still showing the original image. See if you can debug and fix this bug.

(HINT - look in the PlacemarkMemStore class)

## Exercise 2

in PlacemarkActivity, if you are editing a placemark OR if the placemark already has an image, change the button label to be 'Change Image' from `Add Image`

## Exercise 3

Introduce a new ImageView into the card displayed on PlacemarkListAcivity (card_placemark.xml). Display the placemark images here (if an image has been loaded).
