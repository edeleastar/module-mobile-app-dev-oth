# Deleting a Donation from the Server - Part 2

First, we need to make a small modification to our `DonationAdapter` and add the following to the `MainHolder` class

~~~
itemView.tag = donation._id
~~~

The full class is now :

~~~
class MainHolder constructor(itemView: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView) {

        fun bind(donation: DonationModel) {
            itemView.tag = donation._id
            itemView.paymentamount.text = donation.amount.toString()
            itemView.paymentmethod.text = donation.paymenttype
            itemView.imageIcon.setImageResource(R.mipmap.ic_launcher_round)
        }
    }
~~~

Notice that we're leveraging the `tag` property of the View and *tagging* it with the donations mongo id - we can then retrieve this when the user swipes left and use it to delete from the server.

Next, introduce the following method into your `ReportFragment` which takes an id, creates an anonymous callback to delete a donation matching that id, and also removes it from the Server

~~~
fun deleteDonation(id: String) {
        showLoader(loader, "Deleting Donation $id")
        var callDelete = app.donationService.delete(id)
        callDelete.enqueue(object : Callback<DonationWrapper> {
            override fun onFailure(call: Call<DonationWrapper>, t: Throwable) {
                info("Retrofit Error : $t.message")
                serviceUnavailableMessage(activity!!)
                hideLoader(loader)
            }

            override fun onResponse(
                call: Call<DonationWrapper>,
                response: Response<DonationWrapper>
            ) { hideLoader(loader) }
        })
    }
~~~

and see if you can call it correctly?

Note: You'll need to get at the `tag` property of the `viewHolder.itemView` which *may* need to be passed as a `String`.

Now, when you swipe to delete a Donation, and do a subsequent swipe down to refresh, you should still have the same list - the Donation has been properly deleted from the adapter and the Server.

We'll cover the Edit Feature and FireBase Authentication in the next lab.
