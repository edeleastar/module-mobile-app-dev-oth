# Exercise Solution

## Exercise 1: Bug in Signup

Although signup does correctly authenticate a new user, it does not make a call to `fetchPlacemarks()`. We assume it doesn't need to.

## Solution

However, `fetchPlacemarks()` is performing an important role initialising the database, particularly setting the correct user id. Simplest fix would be to also call `fetchPlacemakrs()` in signup

```kotlin
  fun doSignUp(email: String, password: String) {
    view?.showProgress()
    auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password).addOnCompleteListener(view!!) { task ->
      if (task.isSuccessful) {
        fireStore!!.fetchPlacemarks {
          view?.hideProgress()
          view?.navigateTo(VIEW.LIST)
        }
        view?.hideProgress()
        view?.navigateTo(VIEW.LIST)
      } else {
        view?.hideProgress()
        view?.toast("Sign Up Failed: ${task.exception?.message}")
      }
    }
  }
```

## Exercise 2: Bug in Placemark Location Set

This is the scenario:

- Create a new placemark
- It should be set automatically to the phone's current location
- Edit this new location and drag marker elsewhere
- Save this new location

At this point you may notice that the location has been reset to the 'current' location - i.e. the location you set manually is being ignored.

The reason for this is that we are continually getting location updates - even after the user has manually set the placemark location.

## Solution

Introduce a new attribute in PlacemarkPresenter

## PlacemarkPresenter

```kotlin
  ...
  var locationManualyChanged = false;
  ...
```

When the user wishes to set the location manually we set this to true:

```kotlin
  ...
  fun doSetLocation() {
    locationManualyChanged = true;
    view?.navigateTo(VIEW.LOCATION, LOCATION_REQUEST, "location", Location(placemark.location.lat, placemark.location.lng, placemark.location.zoom))
  }
  ...
```

Finally, when we recieve location updates, we ignore them if the user has set the location of the placemark manually:

```kotlin
  ...
  @SuppressLint("MissingPermission")
  fun doResartLocationUpdates() {
    var locationCallback = object : LocationCallback() {
      override fun onLocationResult(locationResult: LocationResult?) {
        if (locationResult != null && locationResult.locations != null) {
          val l = locationResult.locations.last()
          if (!locationManualyChanged) {
            locationUpdate(Location(l.latitude, l.longitude))
          }
        }
      }
    }
    if (!edit) {
      locationService.requestLocationUpdates(locationRequest, locationCallback, null)
    }
  }
  ...
```
