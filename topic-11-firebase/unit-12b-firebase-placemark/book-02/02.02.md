# Image Management

Currently we load all of the images using a helper method we have written for this purpose. We will replace this now with the Glide library:

- <https://github.com/bumptech/glide>

This will work as as currently, but additionally it will also work with url of images on the public Internet. This will be part of our move to firebase later in this lab.

First, we define the version of Glide we wish to use:

## build.gradle

~~~gradle
  ...
  implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.11.0'
  ...
~~~

Now we can introduce the glide library wherever we are displaying images:

## PlacemarkAdapter

Replace:

~~~kotlin
      itemView.imageIcon.setImageBitmap(readImageFromPath(itemView.context, placemark.image))
~~~

with

~~~kotlin
      Glide.with(itemView.context).load(placemark.image).into(itemView.imageIcon);
~~~

## PlacemarkView

Replace:

~~~kotlin
    placemarkImage.setImageBitmap(readImageFromPath(this, placemark.image))
~~~

with

~~~kotlin
    Glide.with(this).load(placemark.image).into(placemarkImage);
~~~


## PlacemarkMapView

Replace:

~~~kotlin
      currentImage.setImageBitmap(readImageFromPath(this, placemark.image))
~~~

~~~kotlin
      Glide.with(this).load(placemark.image).into(currentImage);
~~~

Verify that the images appear as before. Recall, we are not storing the images in the cloud yet.
