## PlacemarkMapPresenter

We need a small adjustment to how the PlacemarkMapPresenter creates markers - currently we have this line in PlacemarkMapPresenter::doPopulateMap()

~~~kotlin
      map.addMarker(options).tag = it.id
~~~

This stores a tag to refer to the placemark associated with the marker we have just placed on the map. Change this to the following:

~~~kotlin
      map.addMarker(options).tag = it
~~~

Now replace onMarkerSelected() with this version:

~~~kotlin
  fun doMarkerSelected(marker: Marker) {
    val placemark = marker.tag as PlacemarkModel
    doAsync {
      uiThread {
        if (placemark != null) view?.showPlacemark(placemark)
      }
    }
  }
~~~

The reason we are making this adjustment is because of the Firebase adjustments we will shortly make to the PlacemarkModel
