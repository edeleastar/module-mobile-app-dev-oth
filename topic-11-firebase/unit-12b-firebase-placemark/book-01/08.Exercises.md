#Solution

Placemark application so far:

- [placemark-11b.zip](archives/placemark-11a.zip)

## Exercise 1: Bug in Signup

Try this experiment:

- Sign up a new user called `1@2.com`
- Log out
- Log in
- Create a new placemark called `test-1`
- Log out
- Log in

Expected behaviour: on the final log in, the placemark should be listed.

No try this:

- Sign up new user `3@4.com`
- Immediately (without loggin out) add a placemark called `test-2`
- Log out
- Log in `3@4.com`

You may see that the placemark you added is no longer listed.

- No log in as 1@2.com

You may see 2 placemarks listed

- test-1
- test-2

However, from now on when you create any additional placemarks with user 3@4.com, they will be correctly stored with that account.

All of the above is the result of a bug in `LoginPresenter`, particularly the `doSignUp()` method.

## Exercise 2: Bug in Placemark Location Set

Try this:

- For an existing placemark, edit the placemark and change its location
- Verify that PlacemarkView shows the correct (updated) location
- Save and repeat

This should work as expected.

Not try this:

- Create a new placemark
- It should be set automatically to the phone's current location
- Edit this new location and drag marker elsewhere
- Save this new location

At this point you may notice that the location has been reset to the 'current' location - i.e. the location you set manually is being ignored.

The reason for this is that we are continually getting location updates - even after the user has manually set the placemark location. This is happening here:

```kotlin
  @SuppressLint("MissingPermission")
  fun doResartLocationUpdates() {
    var locationCallback = object : LocationCallback() {
      override fun onLocationResult(locationResult: LocationResult?) {
        if (locationResult != null && locationResult.locations != null) {
          val l = locationResult.locations.last()
          if (!locationManualyChanged) {
            locationUpdate(Location(l.latitude, l.longitude))
          }
        }
      }
    }
    if (!edit) {
      locationService.requestLocationUpdates(locationRequest, locationCallback, null)
    }
  }
```
