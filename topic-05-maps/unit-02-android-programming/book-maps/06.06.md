# Recover Location from Activity

Currently, when you press back from the MapsActivity, any change made in the marker by the user is lost. We need to address this now.

First, add these fields to the ActivityPlacemark class:

## PlacemarkActivity

```kotlin
  val LOCATION_REQUEST = 2
  var location = Location(52.245696, -7.139102, 15f)
```

When we start the map, we pass the LOCATION_REQUEST code:

```kotlin
   placemarkLocation.setOnClickListener {
      startActivityForResult(intentFor<MapActivity>().putExtra("location", location), LOCATION_REQUEST)
    }
```

Now, when a result is returned, we detect a LOCATION_REQUEST response, and recover the location:

```kotlin
  override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    when (requestCode) {
      IMAGE_REQUEST -> {
        if (data != null) {
          placemark.image = data.getData().toString()
          placemarkImage.setImageBitmap(readImage(this, resultCode, data))
          chooseImage.setText(R.string.change_placemark_image)
        }
      }
      LOCATION_REQUEST -> {
        if (data != null) {
          location = data.extras?.getParcelable<Location>("location")!!
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

Try the app now - and drag the marker to a new location.

When you press back - and you get to the PlacemarkActivity - try pressing Set Location again. What happens? It still doesn't seem to remember the new location.

Introduce some logging statements to see what is happening. We will fix this in the next step.
