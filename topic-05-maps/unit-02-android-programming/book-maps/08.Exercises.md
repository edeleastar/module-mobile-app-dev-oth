#Solution

Placemark application so far:

- [placemark-05.zip](archives/placemark-05.zip)

This archive does not include the Google Maps API keys - so will not build

## Exercise 1

If you create a new placemark - and set it location, note that when you click on the marker it shows its lat/lng. Move it around - and notice that the lat/lng in the panel never changes (even though it is at a different location).

See if you can fix this - such that it always shows the correct location.

(HINT: look up `GoogleMap.OnMarkerClickListener` and `setSnippet`)

## Exercise 2

When you leave the PlacemarkActiviy, the location is not currently stored in the PlacemarkModel correctly. So when you edit a placemark, it is back at the default location.

Fix this by making location part of the placemark model, so we can edit and change the locations for existing markers.

HINT: the simplest way of approach this might be to just extend the model to include three new fields:

```kotlin
@Parcelize
data class PlacemarkModel(var id: Long = 0,
                          var title: String = "",
                          var description: String = "",
                          var image: String = "",
                          var lat : Double = 0.0,
                          var lng: Double = 0.0,
                          var zoom: Float = 0f) : Parcelable
```

... and then manage these accordingly.
