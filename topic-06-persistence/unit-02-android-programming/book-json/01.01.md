# Exercise 1

If you create a new placemark - and set it location, note that when you click on the marker it shows its lat/lng. Move it around - and notice that the lat/lng in the panel never changes (even though it is at a different location).

See if you can fix this - such that it always shows the correct location.

(HINT: look up `GoogleMap.OnMarkerClickListener` and `setSnippet`)

# Solution

Implement OnMarkerClickListener:

## MapActivity

```kotlin
class MapActivity : AppCompatActivity(), OnMapReadyCallback,  GoogleMap.OnMarkerDragListener, GoogleMap.OnMarkerClickListener {


...
  override fun onMarkerClick(marker: Marker): Boolean {
    val loc = LatLng(location.lat, location.lng)
    marker.setSnippet("GPS : " + loc.toString())
    return false
  }
...
```

We need to make sure we listen for this event:

```kotlin
  override fun onMapReady(googleMap: GoogleMap) {
    ...
    map.setOnMarkerClickListener(this)
    ...
  }
```

This should work as expected now.

## Exercise 2

When you leave the PlacemarkActiviy, the location is not currently stored in the PlacemarkModel correctly. So when you edit a placemark, it is back at the default location.

Fix this by making location part of the placemark model, so we can edit and change the locations for existing markers.

# Solution

First, extend the model to include additional fields:

## PlacemarkModel

```kotlin

@Parcelize
data class PlacemarkModel(var id: Long = 0,
                          var title: String = "",
                          var description: String = "",
                          var image: String = "",
                          var lat : Double = 0.0,
                          var lng: Double = 0.0,
                          var zoom: Float = 0f) : Parcelable
```

We are still keeping Location model for use with the MapsActivity

Make sure these fields are saved when a placemark us updated:

## PlacemarkMemStore

```kotlin
  override fun update(placemark: PlacemarkModel) {
    var foundPlacemark: PlacemarkModel? = placemarks.find { p -> p.id == placemark.id }
    if (foundPlacemark != null) {
      foundPlacemark.title = placemark.title
      foundPlacemark.description = placemark.description
      foundPlacemark.image = placemark.image
      foundPlacemark.lat = placemark.lat
      foundPlacemark.lng = placemark.lng
      foundPlacemark.zoom = placemark.zoom
      logAll();
    }
  }
```

Then, remove Location from being a class member if PlacemarkActivity:

## PlacemarkActivity

```kotlin
 // var location = Location(52.245696, -7.139102, 15f)
```

Initialise the location from the placemark object (if zoom is not 0.0. in which case we use a default location)

```kotlin
    placemarkLocation.setOnClickListener {
      val location = Location(52.245696, -7.139102, 15f)
      if (placemark.zoom != 0f) {
        location.lat =  placemark.lat
        location.lng = placemark.lng
        location.zoom = placemark.zoom
      }
      startActivityForResult(intentFor<MapActivity>().putExtra("location", location), LOCATION_REQUEST)
    }
```

Finally, make sure we recover and save the location when the maps activity finishes:

```kotlin
  override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    when (requestCode) {
      IMAGE_REQUEST -> {
        if (data != null) {
          placemark.image = data.getData().toString()
          placemarkImage.setImageBitmap(readImage(this, resultCode, data))
          chooseImage.setText(R.string.change_placemark_image)
        }
      }
      LOCATION_REQUEST -> {
        if (data != null) {
          val location = data.extras?.getParcelable<Location>("location")!!
          placemark.lat = location.lat
          placemark.lng = location.lng
          placemark.zoom = location.zoom
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

You should now be able to edit placemarks, and successfully change their location.
