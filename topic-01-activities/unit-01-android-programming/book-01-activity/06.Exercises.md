# Solution

Placemark application so far:

- [placemark-01.zip](archives/placemark-01.zip)

## Exercise 1:

Download, expand and open in Studio the sample solution above. Run it in the emulator.

## Exercise 2:

Make sure you can auto import the correct libraries when you introduce referenced. As an exercise, delete all of the imports from PlacemarkActivity:

```kotlin
package org.wit.placemark.activities

// deleted imports..

class PlacemarkActivity : AppCompatActivity(), AnkoLogger {

  var placemark = PlacemarkModel()

  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_placemark)
    info("Placemark Activity started..")

    btnAdd.setOnClickListener() {
      placemark.title = placemarkTitle.text.toString()
      if (placemark.title.isNotEmpty()) {
        info("add Button Pressed: $placemarkTitle")
      }
      else {
        toast ("Please Enter a title")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now reintroduce them one-by-one. Keep a close eye on any choices you make as you do this.

## Exercise 3:

Create an ArrayList of Placemarks in PlacemarkActivity - and add each new placemark to this list.

Log all placemarks when a new one is entered.

HINT: Here is a simple placemark array declaration + creation:

```
  val placemarks = ArrayList<PlacemarkModel>()
```

This is the documentation on lists in general:

- <https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/collections.html>

Greater emphasis is placed here on mutability - which we can explore at a later stage.

## Exercise 4:

Create new text field `description` + log when entered. This will require you to:

- and a new field in the layout
- add a new entry in the strings.xml file
- expend the model
- recover the field in the event handler and include in the model objects
- log the new field
