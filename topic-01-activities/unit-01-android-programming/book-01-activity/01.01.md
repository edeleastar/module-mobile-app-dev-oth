# Style & String Resources

Before proceeding to introduce new features into our app - we will augment some of the libraries:

## build.gradle

```
...
  implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.2.0'
...
```

Make sure you include the above in the correct build.gradle file (there are two). Append it to the other `implementation` entries. When you make the above change you will be invited to `sync` the project again - do this now.

This is an additional library to support android components and layouts not included in the base SDK:

- <https://material.io/develop/android>
- <https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started>

Also, change our theme:

## styles.xml

```xml
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
```

This replaces the 'DarkActionBar' theme in the generated style

Now change the colours:

## colours.xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
  <color name="colorPrimary">#FFFFFF</color>
  <color name="colorPrimaryDark">#000000</color>
  <color name="colorAccent">#4c90af</color>
</resources>
```

Or choose other colours as you please...

We also need a new string for the button, which we will introduce in the next step:

## strings.xml

```xml
  <string name="button_addPlacemark">Add Placemark</string>
```
